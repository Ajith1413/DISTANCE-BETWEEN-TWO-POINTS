# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import numpy into the editor.
### Step 2:
Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](![image](https://github.com/Ajith1413/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/139842524/e8e81036-6520-4b67-aaa4-85d99b96d122)
)
### Step 4: 
Print the solution.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
